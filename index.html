                <p class="intro">
                    My name is Paula Tran and I am a senior at the University of Oklahoma. Currently, I am in the Price College of Business and College of Arts and Sciences with the major Business (Management Information Systems).

                    In 2016, I was chosen to be a part of President’s Community Scholars, a highly selective program that focuses on developing skills that are essential to community service. The program has given me the opportunity to utilize my communication and networking skills on a regular basis as I interact with others who share the same interest as me in serving the community. With the program, I had the amazing opportunity to study abroad in Southern Italy in locations such as Catania and Sorrento. Within this organization, I held a Mentor position and currently serve on the Advisory Council. These two roles have allowed me to communicate with the current class and executive officers regarding the development of our goals and objectives as a student at the University.

                    In addition, being apart of the JcPenney Leadership Program and Multicultural Business Program has helped me develop leadership, communication, and networking skills in a professional setting. Some of these lessons include soft skills and developing my strengths.
